"""Database containing additional optional info about common gir files.

The gir files don't contain all the info we would like to have so this is a
collection of various information about the relation of the girs and their
projects and additional data fetched from other sources.

See tools/fetch-*.py for scripts which updates some of this info from external
sources.
